php-forum-error
===============

The forum when trying to sign in gives me the error that the username and password does not exists but it exists and i create it through the database. I thing the problem is on the code. Can you check it? The code belongs to this website:  http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-phpmysql-powered-forum-from-scratch--net-10188
